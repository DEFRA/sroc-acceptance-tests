/**
 * Load the cypress-dotenv plugin and read env vars for a specific environment
 *
 * Each environment (DEV, TEST, PRE-PROD etc) has config specific to it which we also need to keep secret and not commit
 * to the repo. Reading these values from environment variables is the '12-factor app' way to do this but we also want
 * to be able to quickly switch between them.
 *
 * The dotenv package supports this by automatically loading env vars from a file when an app loads rather than having
 * to set them before hand in our profile or bash session.
 *
 * The cypress-dotenv package takes this one step further by allowing you to override expected config such as `baseUrl`
 * with an env var. It also will make anything declared as `CYPRESS_MY_VAR` available in the tests using
 * `Cypress.env('MY_VAR')`.
 *
 * Using https://docs.cypress.io/api/plugins/configuration-api.html#Switch-between-multiple-configuration-files as an
 * inspiration we have added the ability to set an environment when cypress is called and have the project read its
 * config from a matching `environments/.env` file
