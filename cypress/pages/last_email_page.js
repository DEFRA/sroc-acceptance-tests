class LastEmailPage {
  /**
   * Get the last email stored in the TCM
   *
   * The TCM when running in our non-production environments stores in a local cache details of the last email sent.
   * Along with that is a special endpoint that returns the last email as a JSON object. We can then use this in our
   * testing to confirm emails are working and journeys that require interacting with a link sent in an email can be
   * included.
   *
   * The details are _not_ stored in the cenral DB. They are cached in the running instance. The issue when it comes
   * to a production setup, like our AWS environments, is that we have multiple instances of the app running at all
   * times. So, we could trigger an email on instance A, but when we then visit the `/last-email` page we are routed to
   * instance B. This is something we have experienced on WEX, WCR and FRAE when testing and solved by using polling.
   *
   * We send the request to `GET` the last email page up to 10 times. Each time we check what we find against what we
   * expect to see. Once we have confirmed we are viewing the expected email we pass control back. If however, we don't
   * get a match we reduce the poll count by 1 and then use recursion to try again. In the event no email has the
   * details we expect to find we through an error.
   *
   * @param {string[]} expectedText Array of strings which represent text we expect to find in the email body to
   *                   determine we have the right 'last email'. Defaults to an empty array.
   * @param {number} pollCount Number of times to poll the endpoint. Defaults to 10.
