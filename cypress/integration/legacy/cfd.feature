Feature: CFD (Water Quality) Legacy

  Background:
    Given I sign in as the admin user

  Scenario: Legacy test
    Then the user menu is visible
    And the main heading is 'Transactions to be billed'
    And the user menu says I am signed in as 'Admin User'
    And I select 'Water Quality' from the Regime menu
    And I select 'Imported Transaction Files' from the Transactions menu
    And the main heading is 'Imported Transaction Files'
    And the first record has file reference 'CFDAI00394'
    And I select 'Transactions to be billed' from the Transactions menu
    And the main heading is 'Transactions to be billed'
    And I log the number of transactions displayed
    # If the TCM had no transactions the legacy test would then skip approx 600 lines of testing!
    # We've assumed we'll always be running this against an environment that at least has our basic test data. We will
    # always attempt to run the following steps.
    And I log which region is selected in the search bar
    And I select All for financial year in the search bar
    And I select 50 for items per page in the paging info bar
    And I see the 'Ver' column is displayed
    And I see the 'Dis' column is displayed
    Then I copy the consent reference from the first transaction
    And search transactions with it
    And all transactions displayed have the same consent reference
    Then I select a category for each transaction
    And the transaction categories will be set
    And the transaction charges will be set
    And approve the transactions for billing
    And generate the transaction file
    Then I see confirmation the transaction file is queued for export
    And I log the transaction filename to prove it can be used in another step
    And there are no transactions to be billed displayed anymore
    And I select 'Transaction File History' from the Transactions menu
    And the main heading is 'Transaction File History'
    And I set region to A
    And I set pre post-sroc to Post
    And I select 'Excluded Transactions' from the Transactions menu
    And the main heading is 'Excluded Transactions'
    And I select 'Transaction History' from the Transactions menu
    And the main heading is 'Transaction History'
    Then I set view to 'Pre-April 2018 Transactions to be billed'
    And the main heading is 'Pre-April 2018 Transactions to be billed'
    # At this point in the legacy tests we set the region, clear the search field and then hit search. But with an
    # automates test this does nothing. Region A is already selected and the search field is already empty. So, clicking
    # search is the equivalent of just doing a page refresh. So, we've omitted the clear and search but left the region
    # selection for kicks!
    And I set retrospectives region to A
    And I grab the first record and confirm its period is pre-April 2018
    Then I generate the pre-sroc transaction file
    Then I see confirmation the transaction file is queued for export
