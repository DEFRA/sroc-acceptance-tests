Feature: WML (Installations) Legacy

  Background:
    Given I sign in as the admin user

  Scenario: Legacy test
    Then the user menu is visible
    And the main heading is 'Transactions to be billed'
    And the user menu says I am signed in as 'Admin User'
    And I select 'Waste' from the Regime menu
    And I select 'Imported Transaction Files' from the Transactions menu
    And the main heading is 'Imported Transaction Files'
    And the first record has file reference 'WMLAI00394'
    And I select 'Transactions to be billed' from the Transactions menu
    And the main heading is 'Transactions to be billed'
    And I log the number of transactions displayed
    # If the TCM had no transactions the legacy test would then skip approx 600 lines of testing!
    # We've assumed we'll always be running this against an environment that at least has our basic test data. We will
    # always attempt to run the following steps.
    And I log which region is selected in the search bar
    # In CFD and PAS the legacy test selects All from the financial year drop down. In WML the code is commented out.
    # This is most likely because when manually viewing the page 'All' is not an option
    And I select 50 for items per page in the paging info bar
    Then I copy the consent reference from the first transaction
    And search transactions with it
    And all transactions displayed have the same consent reference
    And all transactions displayed have the same consent reference
    Then I select a category for each transaction
    And the transaction categories will be set
    And the transaction charges will be set
    And approve the transactions for billing
    And generate the transaction file
    Then I see confirmation the transaction file is queued for export
    And there are no transactions to be billed displayed anymore
    And I select 'Transaction File History' from the Transactions menu
    And the main heading is 'Transaction File History'
    And I set region to A
    And I select 'Excluded Transactions' from the Transactions menu
    And the main heading is 'Excluded Transactions'
    And I select 'Transaction History' from the Transactions menu
    And the main heading is 'Transaction History'
